# SpreadsheetPanel()

SpreadsheetPanel() is an editor component for interacting with table data. The code was extracted from my "Intellisheets-Client" repo, which had the editor and spreadsheet manager logic in one place.

I extracted this component out, because I felt modularization would help me better manage the ecosystem, isolate bugs, etc.

This component will eventually be published as a npm private package, that will be consumed in a separate spreadsheet manager repo.
